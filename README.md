# SIQM
This repository constains the revelent codes used in constructing the precessing gravitational waveform model with Spin-Induced Quadrupole Moments (SIQM) introduced.

The relevant papers are "Efficient fully precessing gravitational waveforms for binaries with neutron stars" [arXiv:2212.04657
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04657) and "Probing Spin-Induced Quadrupole Moments in Precessing Compact Binaries", [arXiv:2308.09032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09032).
